class Solution:
    """
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    You can return the answer in any order.

    Best Case -
    Time complexity is O(n) since we have to traverse through all the elements of the array atleast once

    Sol 1 -
    Pick element 1 and scan through every element after it and check if they add up to target. Keep repeating till last element.
    Time complexity is O(n^2) and Space Complexity is O(n)

    Soln 2 -
    Use Hashmap where k=element and v=index of element
    Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n)
