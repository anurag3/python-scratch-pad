class Solution:

    Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
    remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
    The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
    Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

    Best Case -
    Time complexity is O(n) since we have to traverse through all the elements of the array atleast once

    Soln 1 -
    Use the 2 pointer method. We can have a left pointer and right pointer. Right pointer will keep on incrementing till it finds the
    unique value and when it finds a unique value, left pointer will place that unique value in its current position and
    move to the next spot. We can have a counter for when the left pointer moves

    Time complexity is O(n) since we have to traverse through all the elements of the array atleast once and Space Complexity is O(1)
