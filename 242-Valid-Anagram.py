class Solution:
    """
    Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
    An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

    Best Case -
    Time complexity of O(n) as we have to traverse through all the elements of s and t atleast once

    Soln 1 -
    Convert s and t to list and then check if they are equal.
    Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n)

    Soln 2 -
    Use collections.Counter(). This measures frequency of the elements but ignores the order.
    Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n)

    Soln 3 -
    Build hashmap with key-value pair for both strings where key is the letter and value is frequency. Then match the key value pairs for both
    Time complexity is O(s+t) -> O(n) and Space Complexity is O(s+t) -> O(n)

    Soln 4 -
    Sort the arrays and compare them. Considering avg time complexity for sorting algorithms
    Time complexity is O(nlogn) and Space Complexity is O(1)
