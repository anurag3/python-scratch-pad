class Solution:
    """
    Question - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
    
    Best Case - 
    Time complexity of O(n) as we have to traverse through the array atleast once

    Soln 1 - 
    Bruteforce solution is to compare every element in the array with every other element. 
    Time complexity is O(n^2) and Space Complexity is O(1)
    
    Soln 2 - 
    Sort the array and then check with the adjacent element. 
    Time complexity is O(nlogn) and Space Complexity is O(1)
    
    Soln 3 - 
    Convert the list to set and check if their lengths match. 
    Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n)
    
    Soln 4 -
    Create Hashset and check for duplicates while adding elements to it. 
    Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n)
