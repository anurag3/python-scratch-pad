    Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

    Soln 1 Iteratively (using references) - 
    We can use 2 pointer method. One pointer "Current" and "Prev". 
    We store the current pointer.next to a var, then update current pointer.next to point to prev node
    Then move the prev node to current node and finally move the current to next node with the stored var
 
    Time complexity is O(n) since we have to traverse through all the elements atleast once and 
    Space Complexity is O(1) since we are moving only the pointers

    Soln 2 Recursively
