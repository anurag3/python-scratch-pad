    """
    Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. 
    The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
    
    Best Case - Time complexity is O(n) since we have to traverse through all the elements of the array atleast once

    Sol -
    When encoding the string, we will be adding len of string followed by a delimiter and then the actual string
